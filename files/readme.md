## ChSe-Decagon_monopharmacy

    Drug side-effect association network
    Dataset information
    
    This is a drug side-effect association network that contains information on side effects caused by drugs that are on the U.S. market. Nodes represent drugs and side effects, and edges indicate recorded adverse drug reactions. 
    


## ChCh-Miner_durgbank-chem-chem : 

    Drug-drug interaction network
    
    Drug-drug interaction network
    Dataset information
    
    This is a network of interactions betweeen drugs, which are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Nodes represent drugs and edges represent drug interactions. Drug-drug interactions occur when the pharmacologic effect of a one drug is altered by the action of another drug, leading to unpredictable clinical effects such as adverse drug reactions. When several drugs are administered together, there might be a greater possibility of adverse drug reactions as one drug can increase or decrease the effect of another drug. It is thus crucial to identify drug-drug interactions, especially during drug development, when one needs to identify interactions between a new candidate drug and drugs that are already on the market.
